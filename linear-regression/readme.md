### Linear Regression Algorithms

These are the linear regression and multi-linear regresion models built from scratch.

* Linear regression model 1 (file named similarly) is the linear regression model which uses average of highest and lowest 
price of the day as the target value and predicts the closing price for the day. Accuracy of the model for the given data is about 78%.

* Linear regression model 2 (file named similarly) is the multi-linear regression model with sliding window concept. Here 
the width of the window is taken as 5 days. Accuracy of the model for the given model is about 54%.

The dataset used for training the models is the stock NSE market data of company ITC Ltd for time period 03-01-2022 to 31-01-2023.
The is obtained using the Yahoo Finance library in python.
