## Introduction
In the field of supervised machine learning, we often encounter tasks where we have input data and corresponding output labels, and our goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. This repository provides implementations of several fundamental supervised learning algorithms that can assist you in building predictive models and making informed decisions based on data.

## Algorithms
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm. Given a new data point, KNN assigns it a class label based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in the training data.

### Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It's commonly used for classification tasks. Despite its "naive" assumption of feature independence, it often performs surprisingly well in practice.

### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a basic regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It finds the best-fitting linear equation to predict the target variable.

### Multilinear Regression
Multilinear Regression is an extension of Linear Regression to multiple independent variables. It's suitable for scenarios where the target variable depends on more than one feature.

### Decision Tree
