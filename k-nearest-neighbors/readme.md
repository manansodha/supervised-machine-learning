k Nearest Neighbor algorithm implementation from scratch.
[Iris data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) from UCI Repository is used for train 
the model. Initially only sepal attributes are considered but can be interchanged with petal 
attributes also.

This program chooses random test data each time the program is run and hence can give out varing 
accuracy, presicion and f1 values.
