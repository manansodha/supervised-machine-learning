### Naive Bayes Algorithm

Implementation of naive bayes algorithm from scratch. The dataset used for training the model is the [diabetes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/himanshunakrani/naive-bayes-classification-data) from Kaggle.

This algorithm gives the different metrics for the given data as follows:
* Precision: 0.91
* Recall 1.0 
* F1: 0.95
* Specificity 0.91
